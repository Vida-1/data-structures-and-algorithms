# Challenge Summary
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats.
The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
Implement the following methods:
* enqueue
  * Arguments: animal

    * animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
* dequeue
  * Arguments: pref

    * pref can be either "dog" or "cat"
Return: either a dog or a cat, based on preference.
If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Whiteboard Process

I considered the problem more and re-worked the whiteboard for better (or far, far worse) -see draft 2.

## Approach & Efficiency
I've come up with two possible solutions one of which has great potential to either bog down the shelter's servers, devour all available memory, or do nothing untoward at all. More study is needed to determine the most likely outcome. The other solution I think has time and space complexities O(N).

## Solution
