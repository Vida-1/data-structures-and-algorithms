    <h2>Challenge #1:</h2>
    <p>
      Write a function named updateAnimal that takes in array of animals (strings) and some callback function.

      This function should first create a new array. Then iterate over the input array and modify each value based on
      the
      callback function provided.

      Push each updated animal string into the new array. Return the new array.

      HINT: Look at the tests to see how the callback functions are used.
    </p>
    <h2>Challenge #2:</h2>
    <p>
      Write a function called sortNames that takes an array of names and sorts them alphabetically. Capital letters
      should
      come before lowercase letters.

      For example: 'Cat' would come before 'apple'
    </p>
    <h2>Challenge #3:</h2>
    <p>
      Write a function called sortNumbers that takes an array of numbers and sorts them from smallest to largest.

      HINT: Beware... JS default is "Lexical" ordering.
    </p>
    <h2>Challenge #4:</h2>
    <p>
      Write a function named sortBackwards that takes in an array of numbers and returns the same array, with the
      numbers
      sorted, largest to smallest.

      HINT: Do it with a custom sort callback, not with using `.reverse()`. ;)
    </p>

    <h2>Challenge #5:</h2>
    <p>
      Write a function named alphabetize that takes in an array of strings and returns the same array with the strings
      sorted
      alphabetically.

      In this alphabetization, capital letters come before lower case letters.

      For example, ['Alphabet', 'Zebra', 'alphabet', 'carrot'] is correctly sorted.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenge #6:</h2>
    <p>
      Write a function named sortByPrice that takes in an array of objects, each of which has a 'price' property, and
      sorts
      those objects by price, lowest to highest, returning the same array.

      Here is an example of the input:
      [
      {name: 'Sweatshirt', price: 45},
      {name: 'Bookmark', price: 2.50},
      {name: 'Tote bag', price: 15}
      ];
    </p>

    <h2>Stretch Goal (7): Not attempted yet.</h2>
    <p>
      Write a function named alphabetizeBetter that takes in an array of strings and returns the same array, with the
      strings
      sorted alphabetically. Capitalization should not change the sort order of two strings.

      For example, ['Alphabet', 'alphabet', 'carrot', 'Zebra'] is correctly sorted, and so is ['alphabet', 'Alphabet',
      'carrot', 'Zebra'].
    </p>


    <h2>Stretch Goal (8): Not attempted yet.</h2>
    <p>
      Write a function named sortByLength that takes in an array of strings and returns the same array, with the strings
      sorted by their length, lowest to highest.
    </p>

    <h2>Stretch Goal (9): Not attempted yet.</h2>
    <p>
      Write a function named sortNumbersByLength that takes in an array of numbers and sorts those numbers by their
      length.

      For example, [1, 14, 0.2, -281, 54782] is only correctly sorted in that order.
    </p>

    <h2>Stretch Goal (10): Not attempted yet.</h2>
    <p>
      Write a function named sortPeople that takes in an array of Person objects, each of which has firstName, lastName,
      and
      age properties, and sorts those people by their last names. Do not worry about capitalization or first names.
    </p>

    <h2>Stretch Goal (11): Not attempted yet.</h2>
    <p>
      Write a function named sortPeopleBetter that takes in an array of Person objects, each of which has firstName,
      lastName,
      and age properties, and sorts those people by their last names.

      If two people share the same last name, alphabetize on their first name.

      If two people have the same full name, the younger one should come first. Do not worry about capitalization.
    </p>

    <h2>Stretch Goal (12): Not attempted yet.</h2>
    <p>
      Write a function named sortMeetingsByDay that takes in an array of objects, each of which represents a meeting
      happening
      a particular day of the week, with a particular start time and end time.

      Sort the meetings by the day on which they happen, Monday-Friday. It does not matter which order meetings come in
      on a
      particular day. For example, if there are two meetings on Monday, it does not matter which comes first.
    </p>

    <h2>Stretch Goal (13): Not attempted yet.</h2>
    <p>
      This challenge should use the array of meetings from challenge 12, above.

      Sort the meetings in the order that they start. If two meetings start at the same time on the same day, the
      shorter
      meeting should come first.

      You DO NOT need to use your solution to Challenge 12 in completing Challenge 13.
