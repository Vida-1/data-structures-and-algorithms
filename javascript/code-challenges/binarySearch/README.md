Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
_What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach?_
I approached this problem with a while loop solution as it seemed the most direct solution path at this stage in my development.
As we have only one loop Time = O(N); as each item is output only once Space = O(N).
