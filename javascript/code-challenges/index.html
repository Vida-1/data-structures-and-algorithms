  <main>

    <h2>Challenge #1:</h2>
    <p>Write a function named `addOne` that takes an array of numbers, and returns a new array of the numbers, incremented by 1.
    
    Use `forEach` to loop over the input array and work with each value. Push the new value into a local array. Return the
    local array;
      
    </p>
    <h2>Challenge #2:</h2>
    <p>
    Write a function named `addExclamation` that takes an array of strings, and returns a new array of the same strings with
    an "!" added to the end.
    
    Use `forEach` to loop over the input array. Modify each string, and add the updated value into a local array. Return the
    local array;

    </p>
    <h2>Challenge #3:</h2>
    <p>
        Write a function named `allUpperCase` that takes an array of strings, and returns a new array of the strings converted
        to upper case.
        
        Use `forEach` to loop over the input array. The modified strings should each be added into a local array. Return that
        local array.
      

    </p>
    <h2>Challenge #4:</h2>
    <p>Write a function named `greeting` that takes in a single string and returns the string in all uppercase letters, and followed by an "!"
    
    Then, write a function named `speaker` that takes in an array of strings and a callback function. Use `forEach` to build a new array of strings, each string modified by the callback. Return the new array.</p>

    <h2>Challenge #5:</h2>
    <p>
        Write a function named addValues that takes in an array and a value and pushes the value into the array. This function
        does not need a return statement.
        
        Then, write a function named addNumbers that takes in four arguments:
        - A number to be added to an array
        - An array into which the number should be added
        - The number of times the number should be added
        - A callback function to use to add the numbers to the array (Hint: you already defined it)
        
        Within the addNumbers function, invoke the callback function as many times as necessary, based on the third argument of
        the addNumbers function.
        
        Return the modified array.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenge #6:</h2>
    <p>
    Write a
    function named createList that takes in an array of the current store intentory. The inventory is formatted like this:
    [ { name: 'apples' , available: true }, { name: 'pears' , available: true }, { name: 'oranges' , available: false }, {
    name: 'bananas' , available: true }, { name: 'blueberries' , available: false } ] This function should use forEach to
    populate your grocery list based on the store's inventory. If the item is available, add it to your list. Return the
    final list.
    </p>

    <h2>Stretch Goal: Not attempted yet.</h2>
    <p>
    Write a function named fizzbuzz that takes in an array of numbers.
    
    Iterate over the array using forEach to determine the output based on several rules:
    - If a number is divisible by 3, add the word "Fizz" to the output array.
    - If the number is divisible by 5, add the word "Buzz" to the output array.
    - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, add the phrase "Fizz Buzz" to the output array.
    - Otherwise, add the number to the output array.
    
    Return the resulting output array.
